# svm
Used the Iris data set to understand the SVM , Support Vector Machine, 

## Here I have used e1071 library for svm, I have Explained the formula, how to separate the dichotomous class using the boundry for linear case.

```
# in this 2D case the hyperplane is the line w[1,1]*x1 + w[1,2]*2 + b = 0
```
